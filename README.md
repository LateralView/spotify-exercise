## A Frontend developer exercise

This exercise is made to test your abilities to solve a typical frontend issue.

Basically, you'll need to connect our current backend to be able to do the searches and represent the information.
The application should be fully responsibe, as target from iphone 5 to desktop (1080p).

This should be done following the [Toddmotto Styleguide](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide), and at least 80% of code coverage by unit test.

The technology used on the frontend side should be:
* Javascript ES6+.
* A+ Promise Syntax (the q library is allowed).
* Angular 1.5.X (Component Based Flavor)
* Gulp as Task Runner.
* Webpack, Babel and Babel-Polyfill to parse the ES6 Code.
* SASS as CSS Preprocessor.
* Mocha, Karma, Chai and Sinnon for Unit-Testing.
